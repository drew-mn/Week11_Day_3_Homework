## Introduction to Debugging in IDE


1.   What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
Breakpoints are used to test and debug programs by stopping the program at specified points     so that the     program can be examined in stages.

2.    Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
No, it pauses the program before the line of code on the breakpoint.

3.    How do we debug the next line of code?
Using the ‘step over’ option from the debugger console. 

4.    What does the step into command do?
Step into will switch to the selected method and pause at the top of that method. 

5.    What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
Evaluate expression evaluates single line methods contained within the code.
Evaluate code fragment runs and evaluates multiple methods and lines of code. It can also create temporary               variables.
